Moroni 5
Chapter 5

Moroni 5:1
 1 The manner of administering the wine--Behold, they took the
cup, and said:

Moroni 5:2
 2 O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee, in the name of thy
Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this wine to the souls
of all those who drink of it, that they may do it in remembrance
of the blood of thy Son, which was shed for them; that they may
witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they do always
remember him, that they may have his Spirit to be with them.
Amen.
