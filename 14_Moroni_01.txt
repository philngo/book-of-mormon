Moroni 1
Chapter 1

Moroni 1:1
 1 Now I, Moroni, after having made an end of abridging the
account of the people of Jared, I had supposed not to have
written more, but I have not as yet perished; and I make not
myself known to the Lamanites lest they should destroy me.

Moroni 1:2
 2 For behold, their wars are exceedingly fierce among
themselves; and because of their hatred they put to death every
Nephite that will not deny the Christ.

Moroni 1:3
 3 And I, Moroni, will not deny the Christ; wherefore, I wander
whithersoever I can for the safety of mine own life.

Moroni 1:4
 4 Wherefore, I write a few more things, contrary to that which I
had supposed; for I had supposed not to have written any more;
but I write a few more things, that perhaps they may be of worth
unto my brethren, the Lamanites, in some future day, according to
the will of the Lord.
