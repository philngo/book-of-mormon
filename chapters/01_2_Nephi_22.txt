2 Nephi 22:1
 1 And in that day thou shalt say: O Lord, I will praise thee;
though thou wast angry with me thine anger is turned away, and
thou comfortedst me.

2 Nephi 22:2
 2 Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid;
for the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also has
become my salvation.

 3 Therefore, with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of
salvation.

name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his
name is exalted.

known in all the earth.

Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
