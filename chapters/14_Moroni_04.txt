Moroni 4
Chapter 4

Moroni 4:1
 1 The manner of their elders and priests administering the flesh
and blood of Christ unto the church; and they administered it
according to the commandments of Christ; wherefore we know the
manner to be true; and the elder or priest did minister it--

Moroni 4:2
 2 And they did kneel down with the church, and pray to the
Father in the name of Christ, saying:

Moroni 4:3
 3 O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son,
Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of
all those who partake of it; that they may eat in remembrance of
the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal
Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy
Son, and always remember him, and keep his commandments which he
hath given them, that they may always have his Spirit to be with
them. Amen.
