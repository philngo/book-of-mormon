Moroni 3
Chapter 3

Moroni 3:1
 1 The manner which the disciples, who were called the elders of
the church, ordained priests and teachers--

Moroni 3:2
 2 After they had prayed unto the Father in the name of Christ,
they laid their hands upon them, and said:

Moroni 3:3
 3 In the name of Jesus Christ I ordain you to be a priest, (or,
if he be a teacher) I ordain you to be a teacher, to preach
repentance and remission of sins through Jesus Christ, by the
endurance of faith on his name to the end. Amen.

Moroni 3:4
 4 And after this manner did they ordain priests and teachers,
according to the gifts and callings of God unto men; and they
ordained them by the power of the Holy Ghost, which was in them.
